## Installation
Redpaper only works on Linux systems at the moment, therefor only people running Linux  
can use it.  
### Dependencies
* Python 3.6 or later  
* Python3-pip  
* Requests  
* Pillow  
* PyGObject  
* feh (only if you use tiling window managers)

Python3 should come by default on a Linux system, but if you are not sure if it is installed,  
you can run  `python3` in your terminal. If you get no errors, then you can proceed. If you  
get an error, you should  visit python.org to get it.  
Pip comes by default with Python. If for some reason you don't have it, you can run:  
```curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py```  
and then  
```python get-pip.py```
The other dependencies will be automatically installed.  
### Procedure
When the first two dependencies have been met, you can run the following command to do the install:  
```git clone https://github.com/keystroke3/redpaper.git && cd redpaper && sudo sh install.sh```

#### Tiling window managers
If you are running a tiling window manager like i3, bspwm etc.. you will need to add this to your  
autostart files e.g. ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc if you are using bspwm:  
```$HOME/.redpaper/wallapaper.sh```  
This line makes sure that the wallpaper you set will persist after logging in. 
## Usage
To use, simply run `redpaper` in the terminal.
